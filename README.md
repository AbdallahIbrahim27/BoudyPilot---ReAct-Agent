# 🧠 Boudy ReAct Agent

Boudy ReAct Agent is a **reasoning and acting AI agent** built with **Streamlit** and powered by the **Mistral LLM**.  
It implements the **ReAct paradigm** (*Reasoning + Acting loops*), allowing the agent to think, take actions (like search or calculation), observe, and provide answers in a conversational and interactive way.

The app comes with a **colorful, animated UI**, featuring Lottie animations, color-coded thoughts/actions/observations, and a dynamic sidebar.
